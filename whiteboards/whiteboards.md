# Whiteboard Notes

## Problem Domain
- After or while the interviewer is asking the questions. Start typing the prompt.
- After the the interviewer has asked the question, confirm that you are solving the right problem by REPEATING the problem
    - EXAMPLE: "Is it okay if I over the prompt with you just to make sure I understood the problem correctly?"
    - Read what you just typed out
        - Ask for specifics if they have not been specified
            - "Will data type will the parameters be?"
            - "Is there a specific data type that should be pass in as arguments?"
            - Anything else that you have questions on

EXAMPLE: There is a farmer that needs to count all the legs in his farm. On his farm he has chickens, goats, and horses. Create a function that takes in 3 quantites of each animal and returns the total number of legs on the farm

- "So I plan on making a function with 3 parameters for the following animals: chickens, goats, and horses. Will these value be numbers when passed as arguments?"

- Inputs / Outputs
- input -> chickens = 2, goats = 4, horses = 4 
- output ->  (2 * 2) + (4 * 4) + (4 * 4) = output

- Pseudocode
    - Create a function farmAnimals
        - Takes in 3 parameters for each animal
        - Create create a variable to store the value of chickens * 2
        - Create create a variable to store the value of goats * 4
        - Create create a variable to store the value of horses * 4
    - Add all of the variable together and return the value
- Algorithm

```javascript


const x = () => {
    return "hello world"
}
```
